# TriviaGame

<strong>Project Developer:</strong></br>Jessica Katelyn Blomer

<strong>Project Description:</strong></br> I created a Trivia game using JavaScript for the logic and jQuery to manipulate the HTML. I also added a little CSS styling.</br>
The Trivia Game's theme is World Geograhy.  The player will have a limited amount of time to finish the quiz.  When the timer runs out your score will appear.  There is an option to start the quiz again.
